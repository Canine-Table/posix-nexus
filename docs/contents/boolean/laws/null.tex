		\bftext{Expression:}\smallskip\\

		$ A + 1 = 1 $\\
		 $ A \cdot 0 = 0 $\\

		\bftext{Explanation:} For the Null Law of OR (addition), if $A$ is 1 and you add 1, the result is 1, not 0.
		This is because in Boolean algebra, the OR operation is defined such that any variable OR-ed with 1 results in 1.
		Itâ€™s like saying if either condition is true, the outcome is true regardless of the other condition.\smallskip
