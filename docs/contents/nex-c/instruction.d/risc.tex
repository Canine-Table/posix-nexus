	\begin{NxIDBoxL}
		\nxTopicD{ARMv7 (32-bit)} A CPU architecture using 32-bit registers (R0-R15) with support for Thumb (16-bit) instructions and limited to 4GB memory addressing.
		\nxTopicD{ARMv8-A (64-bit)} A modernized 64-bit architecture that replaces 32-bit registers with X0-X30, removes Thumb instructions, and supports terabytes of memory addressing.
		%\nxTopicD{RISC-V} An \textbf{open-source RISC architecture}, enabling fully customizable implementations.
		%\nxTopicD{PowerPC} A \textbf{legacy RISC architecture}, formerly used in Apple Macs and IBM servers.
		%\nxTopicD{MIPS} A \textbf{classic RISC architecture}, commonly found in embedded and networking systems.
		%\nxTopicD{SPARC} A \textbf{RISC architecture designed for scalability}, frequently used in enterprise computing.
