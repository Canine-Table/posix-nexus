\begin{NxSSSSBox}[breakable][BCPL and B]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		The evolution of \nxGID{c_language} begins with \nxGID{bcpl}, developed in 1966 by \nxGID{martin_richards}. BCPL introduced fundamental programming concepts such as structured programming and efficient memory manipulation, making it a valuable language for system software. However, BCPL was relatively verbose and lacked direct hardware control, leading to the creation of B.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		In 1969, \nxGID{ken_thompson}, working on early \nxGID{unix} development, needed a more compact and streamlined language for system-level programming. Inspired by BCPL, Thompson developed B, which simplified syntax and removed unnecessary complexity, making it well-suited for UNIX’s requirements. B allowed direct manipulation of machine instructions while still providing enough abstraction for efficient coding.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Despite its improvements, \nxGID{b_language} had significant limitations—particularly in handling different data types. It lacked strong type definitions, which made program development cumbersome for larger systems. Recognizing these shortcomings, \nxGID{dennis_ritchie} expanded B’s capabilities, introducing explicit data types, more structured control flow, and direct memory management. This refined version became C, a powerful and flexible programming language that could handle both system programming and general software development. The transition from B to C marked a defining moment in programming, leading to the widespread adoption of C across various domains.

\begin{NxSSSSBox}[breakable][Dennis Ritchie]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Dennis Ritchie, a computer scientist at Bell Labs, played a pivotal role in the creation of C. His goal was to develop a language that balanced low-level hardware control with structured programming, providing flexibility for both system and application development.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		The limitations of the B language, particularly in handling different data types, prompted Ritchie to extend its capabilities. He introduced \textbf{explicit data types}, which allowed for precise memory manipulation and improved code readability. C became a \textbf{strongly typed language}, reducing ambiguity and enhancing the reliability of system programs.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Ritchie's vision for C aligned with the development of \textbf{UNIX}, an operating system that required a language capable of writing low-level system software while remaining portable. By designing C with a \textbf{simple syntax, efficient memory management, and direct hardware access}, he ensured it could be easily adapted across different architectures. This decision led to C becoming the foundation of UNIX and, later, many modern operating systems.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Beyond UNIX, Ritchie's work influenced generations of programmers. The publication of \nxGID{c_book_first} (co-authored with \nxGID{brian_kernighan}) in 1978 helped standardize C and established best practices. This book remains one of the most influential programming texts, guiding both new learners and experienced developers in mastering C’s principles.
	\end{NxIDBox}
\end{NxSSSSBox}


\begin{NxSSSSBox}[breakable][UNIX and Early Adoption]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		The development of UNIX and its early adoption played a crucial role in shaping C into one of the most widely used programming languages. UNIX needed a highly flexible yet efficient language capable of handling system-level programming, which led to the refinement and popularization of C.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		In the early 1970s, UNIX was primarily written in assembly language, limiting its portability and making modifications cumbersome. Dennis Ritchie, alongside Ken Thompson, recognized the need for a more adaptable language that could \textbf{retain low-level efficiency while being easier to write and maintain}. This vision led to UNIX being \textbf{re-written in C}, making it one of the first operating systems developed using a high-level language.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		The decision to use C dramatically \textbf{boosted UNIX’s portability}. Unlike assembly, which is hardware-specific, C allowed UNIX to be compiled on different machine architectures with minimal changes. This adaptability helped UNIX spread beyond Bell Labs, \textbf{influencing countless operating systems, compilers, and programming environments} that followed.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		By the late 1970s, C had become \textbf{the standard for system programming}, with universities and tech institutions adopting it in coursework and research. The language’s efficiency, simplicity, and direct hardware interaction made it a \textbf{fundamental tool for writing compilers, networking software, and embedded systems}—cementing its role in software development for decades to come.
