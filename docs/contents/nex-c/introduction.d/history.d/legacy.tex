\begin{NxSSSSBox}[breakable][The Influence of C on Other Languages]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		One of C’s most profound contributions to computing is its influence on modern programming languages. The syntax, structure, and memory management principles introduced in C have shaped numerous languages that followed.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		\textbf{C++}, developed by \nxGID{stroustrup} in the early 1980s, extended C by introducing object-oriented programming while maintaining its efficiency and low-level control. It became a widely used language for large-scale applications and system software.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Languages like \textbf{Java and C\#} borrowed heavily from C’s syntax, making transitions easier for developers. While both languages run on managed runtimes (\nxGID{jvm} and \nxGID{dotnet}), their structural approach to functions, variables, and control flow remains rooted in C.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
	Modern languages such as \nxGID{rust} and \nxGID{golang} also carry elements of C’s philosophy. Rust emphasizes memory safety while preserving the ability for direct hardware interaction, whereas Go simplifies concurrency with a C-like syntax designed for efficiency.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		C’s widespread adoption ensured that its core principles—simplicity, efficiency, and portability—would be passed down across generations of programming languages, reinforcing its role as a foundational influence in computing.
	\end{NxIDBox}
\end{NxSSSSBox}

\begin{NxSSSSBox}[][C in Operating Systems and Infrastructure]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		The role of C in operating systems and infrastructure is unparalleled. From the earliest UNIX systems to modern OS kernels, C has remained the primary language for system-level programming.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		\nxGID{unix} and \nxGID{linux}, both heavily dependent on C, set a precedent for system portability. The decision to rewrite UNIX in C enabled it to run across different architectures, laying the foundation for decades of operating system development.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		\nxGID{windows} and \nxGID{macos} also rely on C for critical components. The Windows kernel, drivers, and core system utilities are predominantly written in C, ensuring efficient performance and low-level hardware interaction.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Beyond traditional operating systems, C powers networking stacks, database engines, and embedded firmware. Technologies like \nxGID{postgresql}, \nxGID{sqlite}, \nxGID{mongodb}, \nxGID{mariadb}, and \nxGID{mysql} are all implemented in C due to its speed and reliability.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Even modern infrastructure like cloud computing and cybersecurity depends on C for performance-critical applications. Its versatility ensures that it remains the backbone of high-performance software solutions.
	\end{NxIDBox}
\end{NxSSSSBox}

\begin{NxSSSSBox}[][Standardization and Longevity]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		One of C’s strongest advantages is its standardized evolution, ensuring long-term compatibility and reliability across computing platforms.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		\textbf{ANSI C (\nxGID{c89})} was the first official standardization effort, ensuring that C programs would compile consistently across different compilers. This milestone solidified C’s place in industry and academia.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
	Later, \textbf{ISO C standards} refined C further, introducing modern enhancements while preserving backward compatibility. \nxGID{c99} improved floating-point precision, while \nxGID{c11} and \nxGID{c18} added multithreading support and memory safety improvements.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Standardization efforts ensured that C remained relevant even as newer languages emerged. Developers continue to rely on C for embedded systems, real-time processing, and performance-critical applications.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Even decades after its creation, C’s longevity is unquestionable. Whether in legacy systems or cutting-edge technology, its standardized nature ensures that it will remain a vital tool in software engineering for years to come.
