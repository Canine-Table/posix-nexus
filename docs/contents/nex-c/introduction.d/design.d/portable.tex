\begin{NxSSSBox}[][Portability and Flexibility]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		One of C’s defining characteristics is its ability to run across multiple architectures with minimal modifications. Unlike many platform-dependent languages, C maintains a balance between portability and direct system interaction.

		\nxTopicD{Standardization for Compatibility} How ANSI and ISO standardization ensured portability across different compilers.
		\nxTopicD{Hardware Independence} Why C abstracts platform-specific details while still allowing low-level control.

\begin{NxSSSSBox}[][Standardization for Compatibility]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		The design of C prioritized portability, leading to the need for standardization. Early implementations varied across systems, which made it difficult for developers to write universally compatible programs.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		To address this, \textbf{ANSI C (C89)} was established as a formal standard, ensuring consistency in syntax, type handling, and library implementations across different platforms. This minimized compiler-specific variations.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		The \textbf{ISO C standards (C99, C11, C18)} refined portability further by introducing additional conventions for floating-point precision, threading, and memory management. These standards ensured long-term compatibility across evolving architectures.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		By designing C around a stable standard, developers could write code that compiled reliably across various systems. This early commitment to portability influenced the creation of numerous cross-platform development tools.
	\end{NxIDBox}
\end{NxSSSSBox}

\begin{NxSSSSBox}[][Hardware Independence]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		C’s design aimed to provide a level of abstraction that allowed programs to run on different architectures without modification, yet still permit system-level optimization.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Unlike assembly, C uses platform-independent data types and control structures. Its design ensures that code does not depend on specific hardware instructions, making it adaptable across processors.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		At the same time, C retains low-level capabilities like direct memory access and bitwise operations, allowing developers to tune their programs for specific hardware without breaking portability.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Compiler features such as \textbf{conditional macros} and \textbf{preprocessor directives} allow developers to maintain portability while optimizing code for different hardware architectures.
	\end{NxIDBox}
\end{NxSSSSBox}

\begin{NxSSSSBox}[][Cross-Platform Development]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		The simplicity of C’s syntax and its emphasis on standard libraries made it a natural choice for developing software that runs across multiple operating systems.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Functions provided by \textbf{the C standard library (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h)} enable consistent input/output operations, memory handling, and string manipulation across platforms.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		C was deliberately designed to support modular programming, allowing developers to write reusable code that functions on different systems with minimal changes.
	\end{NxIDBox}
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		By building software with C, developers can target \textbf{Windows, Linux, macOS, and embedded environments} without needing extensive rewrites, ensuring long-term software maintainability.
	\end{NxIDBox}
