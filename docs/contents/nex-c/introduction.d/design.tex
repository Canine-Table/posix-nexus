\begin{NxSSBox}[][Design Philosophy and How C Was Designed]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		C was designed to be simple, efficient, and portable, making it an ideal choice for system programming and embedded development. Its structured approach enables developers to write code that is both performant and predictable.
