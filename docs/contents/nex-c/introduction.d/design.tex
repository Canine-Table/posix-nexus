\begin{NxSSBox}[][Design Philosophy of C]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		C was designed with efficiency, portability, and minimalism in mind. Unlike many modern languages that prioritize abstraction, C maintains a fine balance between human-readable syntax and low-level hardware control.
		\nxTopicD{sssec:Simplicity and Minimalism}{Simplicity and Minimalism} C avoids excessive abstraction, keeping the language simple, predictable, and lightweight.
		\nxTopicD{sssec:Portability and Flexibility}{Portability and Flexibility} Programs written in C can run across multiple hardware architectures with little modification.
		\nxTopicD{sssec:Efficiency and Direct Hardware Access}{Efficiency and Direct Hardware Access} C provides precise memory control, allowing developers to write highly optimized code.
