	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Instruction Set Computing defines how processors execute machine instructions. Two primary architectures, \nxGID{cisc} and \nxGID{risc}, dictate how CPU instructions are processed, optimized, and structured.

	\begin{NxIDBoxL}
		\nxTopicD{CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing)} CPUs with \textbf{rich instruction sets} that handle complex operations within single instructions.
		%\nxTopicD{RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)} CPUs optimized for \textbf{simple, efficient instructions}, often requiring multiple steps to achieve complex operations.
