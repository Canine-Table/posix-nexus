\begin{NxSBox}[breakable][File Types and Formats]
	\begin{NxIDBox}
		Computer files exist in a variety of formats, each optimized for different use casesâ€”executables, object files, libraries, and debugging symbols. This section explores how these formats function, interact, and play essential roles in software development.

		%\nxTopicD{Application Binary Interface (ABI)}
		\nxTopicD{Binary Formats} Overview of how compiled executables are structured (e.g., ELF, PE, Mach-O) and their role in system execution.
		%\nxTopicD{Linkers and Linking} How linkers combine object files and libraries, resolving symbols and dependencies to create functional executables.
		%\nxTopicD{Object Files} The structure of compiled `.o` files, relocations, and how they fit into linking and execution.
		%\nxTopicD{Toolchains and File Handling} How compilers, assemblers, and binary analysis tools interact with these formats for software development and debugging.
