\begin{NxLightListBox}[title={Tangent vs Sine and Cosine}]
    \nxEachLabel{ArrowDark}{Secondary}{{4}{5}}{%
        {Sine and Cosine}/{Always stay between â€“1 and 1; smooth and periodic},%
        {Tangent}/{Can grow infinitely large or small; has vertical asymptotes},%
        {Cause}/{Tangent is division: \( \tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \); when \( \cos(x) = 0 \), it explodes},%
        {Graph}/{Tangent graph has repeating vertical gaps (asymptotes) every \( \frac{\pi}{2} \)}%
    }
