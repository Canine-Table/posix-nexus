Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, especially right-angled triangles. Its name comes from the Greek:

\[
	\text{rigonon = triangle, metron = measure}
\]

At its core, trigonometry is a ritual of \textbf{ratios} â€” mapping how one side of a triangle relates to another, depending on the angle. These ratios become functions, and those functions become tools for geometry, physics, engineering, and even signal processing.
