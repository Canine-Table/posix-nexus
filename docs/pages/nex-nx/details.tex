		{Shop name}/{Venom \& Velvet},%
		{Business size and reach}/{Venom \& Velvet operates as a small, highly specialized local boutique with a reputation that extends quietly into professional and academic circles. It isn’t a chain, doesn’t pursue mass‑market expansion, and maintains a deliberately limited footprint to preserve strict control over sourcing, handling, and expertise.},%
		{Target audience}/{The shop serves two distinct groups: medical and scientific professionals who require controlled toxic specimens for research, and eccentric private collectors drawn to rare, dangerous flora for their dramatic aesthetics. Everyday shoppers aren’t the focus; the clientele is niche, informed, and intentionally selective.},%
		{Brand personality}/{Venom \& Velvet embodies a tone of dark elegance and meticulous expertise, blending scientific precision with a theatrical appreciation for the beautifully hazardous. The brand feels discreet, refined, and slightly ominous — a curator of rare botanical artifacts rather than a traditional flower shop.}%
