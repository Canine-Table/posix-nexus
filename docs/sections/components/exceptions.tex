\subsection{Exceptions}
The try function is a core part of POSIX-Nexus script's error handling and validation mechanism.
It ensures that commands execute successfully and handle failures gracefully.
By structuring checks and validations using try, we maintain robust, reliable scripts that can preemptively handle potential errors without crashing.

\subsubsection{R Flag (Regular Expressions)}
\textbf{Purpose}: Handle regular expression-related exceptions.

\nexColorBox"worldd"[hello]
\processList{a,b,c,d}
