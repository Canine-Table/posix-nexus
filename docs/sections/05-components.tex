    \begin{posnexItemize}
        \item[$\ast$] Database Management
        \item[$\ast$] SSH Authentication
        \item[$\ast$] Command Distribution across specified Nexuses
        \item[$\ast$] Web server functionalities akin to Cockpit, applicable to any system, not limited to \texttt{systemd}
        \item[$\ast$] Comprehensive security measures ensuring information sharing among Nexuses and connected machines via multicast groups, authenticated through SSH keys
        \item[$\ast$] Interactive menu for managing IP addresses of child machines, enabling secure connections through public keys
        \item[$\ast$] Dual authentication mechanism ensuring both Nexus and group member validation, with an automatic ejection of any machine posing a security risk detected by multiple systems
    \end{posnexItemize}
\end{baseBoxOne}

The POSIX Nexus aims to create a robust network that prioritizes security without compromising usability. Routine tasks are handled via AWK, while advanced features are developed using the C90 standard library.
