        \item[\sA] Database Management
        \item[\sA] SSH Authentication
        \item[\sA] Command Distribution across specified Nexuses
        \item[\sA] Web server functionalities akin to Cockpit, applicable to any system, not limited to \sTE{systemd}
        \item[\sA] Comprehensive security measures ensuring information sharing among Nexuses and connected machines via multicast groups, authenticated through SSH keys
        \item[\sA] Interactive menu for managing IP addresses of child machines, enabling secure connections through public keys
        \item[\sA] Dual authentication mechanism ensuring both Nexus and group member validation, with an automatic ejection of any machine posing a security risk detected by multiple systems
