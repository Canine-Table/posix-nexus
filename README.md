# POSIX-Nexus

POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a set of standards specified by the IEEE to ensure compatibility and portability across different operating systems.

## About This Codebase

This codebase aims to enhance the performance of the POSIX shell by leveraging `awk`, `sed`, and `c90` backends. By offloading data manipulation tasks to these utilities, we achieve significant speed improvements and script execution efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Compatibility**: Adheres to POSIX draft 1003.2 (draft 11.3) standards for broad UNIX-like OS compatibility.
- **Performance**: Utilizes `awk`, `sed`, and `c90`, optimized for handling large datasets and complex text processing tasks.
- **Portability**: Designed to be portable and easily integrated into different environments without modification.

## Usage

Ensure your environment supports POSIX-compliant `awk` and `sed`. Detailed instructions and examples can be found in the `docs` directory.
