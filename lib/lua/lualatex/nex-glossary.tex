\newglossaryentry{unix}{
	name=UNIX,
	description={A multiuser, multitasking operating system developed in 1969 at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. Unix introduced portability, modularity, and powerful command-line tools, influencing modern OSes like Linux, macOS, and BSD.}
}

\newglossaryentry{c_language}{
	name=C,
	description={A general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972. C is known for its efficiency, portability, and direct access to system resources, making it widely used in operating systems, embedded systems, and application development. It influenced many modern languages, including C++, Java, and Python.}
}

\newglossaryentry{bsd}{
	name=Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD),
	description={A Unix-based operating system developed at the University of California, Berkeley, starting in 1978. BSD introduced key advancements such as the TCP/IP networking stack and virtual memory. Though the original BSD is discontinued, its open-source descendants—FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonFly BSD—continue to be widely used in servers, networking, and security applications.}
}

\newglossaryentry{algol}{
	name=ALGOL,
	description={A family of imperative programming languages developed between the 1950s and 1970s. ALGOL introduced structured programming concepts, block scope, and recursive functions, influencing languages like Pascal, C, and Ada. Variants include ALGOL 58, ALGOL 60, and ALGOL 68, each refining syntax and capabilities.}
}

\newglossaryentry{bcpl}{
	name=BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language),
	description={A procedural, imperative programming language developed by Martin Richards in 1967. BCPL was designed for writing compilers and influenced later languages like B and C. It introduced features such as typeless data handling and curly braces for block structuring, making it a foundational step in programming language evolution.}
