							Kimberly Greene, PhD, reviews editor of the International Alliance for Women in Music Journal wrote: âI must say that the music (included on the <i>Aboriginal Inspirations</i> CD) is extremely impressive and provocative; especially your Fire Dance.â
							<br><br>
							Carol Ann Weaver, Professor Emerita of the University of Waterloo submitted a review about <i>Aboriginal Inspirations</i> which was published in the International Alliance for Women in Music Journal. In the review Professor Weaver wrote: âEvelyn Stroobachâs Fire Dance for flute, viola, and drum is a concise, well-constructed piece with excellent counterpoint, which depicts an imagined âevent where people gather around the warmth of the fire and a dance is performed after darkâ (Liner Notes). Stroobachâs musical language allows the listeners to envision both the âmovement and purpose of the danceâ (Liner Notes). In this respect, the violaâs percussive, double-stop rhythm in fast 6/8, answered by the drumâs basic pulse, is followed by an imitative dialogue between flute and viola. As the viola and drum continue a steady beat, the flute transforms into a folk-like soliloquy, before returning to an imitative dialogue with the viola. Throughout the composition, the drum plays mostly unvaried downbeats. Notably, Stroobachâs music allows the two cultural worlds to collide, rather than fully intermingle, creating a stunning musical experience.â

					<i>Aboriginal Inspirations</i> CD was released on April 21st, 2017 at the Embassy of the Republic of Bulgaria in Ottawa, Canada. Stroobach was invited to attend this event. Stroobachâs composition entitled Fire Dance composed for flute, viola and aboriginal drum is included on the disc. Ron Korb (whose CD Asia Beauty was nominated for a Grammy Award) performed the flute, Ralitsa Tcholakova performed the viola and Dominique Moreau performed the drum part.
					<br><br>
					Stroobach as well as the other composers and performers on the CD were honoured in the Senate and the House of Commons at the Houses of Parliament in Ottawa, Canada for their participation on the newly released <i>Aboriginal Inspirations</i> CD.
					<br><br>
					The Canadian Music Centre has agreed to distribute <i>Aboriginal Inspirations</i>, and both the Canadian Music Centre and NAXOS have agreed to do the digital distribution.
					<br><br>
					Ralitsa Tcholakova wrote the following: âThe compositions included on this CD were composed by eight Ottawa-based or born composers whose music was inspired by Canadian aboriginal myths, legends, symbols or issues. The musical compositions highlight the spiritual values of aboriginal people and, in so doing, seek to encourage a dialogue between generations and cultures mediated through art and culture. Music has the unique ability to transform an artistâs feelings and ideas into a powerful cultural phenomenon that embraces the past, the present and the future. This CD project embraces and celebrates, in musical form, the universal need for love and forgiveness.â

<br><br>



On June 23rd, 2006, Stroobach's publisher, Oceanna Music Publications, asked her to give a presentation at the ORMTA (Ontario Registered Music Teachers Association) Convention which was held in Ottawa on her published piano book Medieval Tales. Stroobach's presentation included a talk about the piano compositions in Medieval Tales as well as as a performance of piano works included in the music book in order to illustrate her discussion.

<br><br>



Aury Murray, who is a member of ORMTA, conducted a workshop of 'Modes' at the 'Summer Sizzle' which was held from July 15-17, 2007, in Palmerston, Ontario. Her presentation dealt with the history of modes from ancient Greece to the present day. Since 'Summer Sizzle' promotes the music of Canadian composers, she included in her presentation Stroobach's published piano book Medieval Tales: The Art of the Mode and also performed a work from her book.
<br><br>




Pianist and musicologist, Dr. Joo Yeon Tarina Kim, in her published dissertation, The Solo Piano Music of Selected Contemporary Canadian Women Composers: Database, Audio Samples, and Annotated Bibliography, (2011) wrote: "A truly unique and pedagogically important volume, the Medieval Tales consists of six captivating pieces, each in a different mode. In addition, this collection is quite informative with extensive program notes, relevant music history, performance hints, and illustrations." page 120

					Holocaust - Remembrance
					<br><br>
					Stroobachâs Holocaust - Remembrance is dedicated to the six million Jews, including members of Stroobachâs own family, who were murdered during the Shoah, the largest scale genocide the world has ever known. Stroobachâs choice to compose Holocaust - Remembrance for orchestra and SATB chorus in 60-minutes and six movements is symbolic of the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust. With this work, Stroobach wishes to honour those who were murdered during the Shoah simply because they were Jews and to remember them with respect and dignity. Stroobach also wishes to create awareness/educate audiences about the Shoah with the powerful message of ânever againâ.
					<br><br>

The work has good energy, is bright, but also with nice romantic shades. The sax register was in a good ambitus. I loved to play this piece."

					International Alliance for Women in Music
					<br><br>




					The International Alliance for Women in Music Advocacy Committee asks that its members telephone or e-mail local and/or Internet radio stations during June 18-24, 2017, requesting that they play music by Evelyn Stroobach.
					<br><br>

					As usual, the selection, which is different every week, has been made by Ursula Rempel. The selections, she explains, "are based on a combination of factors: availability of CDs, geography/nationality, accessibility/appeal of the music for general audiences, and a concern to feature both historical and contemporary women composers." 
					<br><br>




					Previously, in August 5-11, 2007, Stroobach was also named composer of the week by the International Alliance for Women in Music.
					<br><br>




					Carol Ann Weaver, Professor Emerita Conrad Grebel University College University of Waterloo and fellow International Alliance for Women in Music member wrote: âYour work is truly impressive, your track record strong, your performance lists impressive.â

Danielle Sametz, Principle Second Violin player, with Symphony New Brunswick, performed the violin part and Andrew Reed Miller, Principle Double Bass player, also with the SNB, performed the double bass part. Andrew Miller wrote: âWe enjoyed playing it, especially the 3rd and 4th movements! The audience dug it too, I remember hearing them sort of gasp a couple times when we finished the last note, as the visceral angry energy is so strong there.â
					<br><br>
					Jennifer Grant, the General Manager of Symphony New Brunswick, wrote: â The audience really enjoyed your piece.â
					<br><br>
					Bereft
					<br><br>
					I - Contemplatively
					<br><br>
					II - Intensity
					<br><br>
					III - Lament
					<br><br>
					IV - Angrily
					<br><br>
					Canary Burton, producer and host of the radio program The Latest Score at WOMR radio, who broadcasts out of Provincetown, Massachusetts, wrote the following about Bereft: âI love that you are using atonality IN THE SERVICE OF MUSIC. (it's a rare thing). The rhythm held it. It seems in the second movement you ease up a bit and sort of spread out maybe get a breath of air. In the third movement. WOWSER! That lick is very cool. It's very listenable. Ah, that waving back and forth before it seems a great dive! Oh the intensity. Again, using the atonal or maybe the a tonal is beautiful in your hands, well in your mind. Mysterioso, lurking about the mind on slippered feet.... You bring that from straight up to misery in no time. Introspection until the cello comes back and energizes the violin with interesting intervals sawed.... And it ends!"

					<br><br>
					Into the Wind and Fire Dance were performed at the 
					<br><br>
					Women of Note concert at the European Union Delegation to Canada in Ottawa
					<br><br>
					Stroobach received a request from Anna Rijk, Senior Advisor Public Diplomacy, Press & Cultural Affairs of the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, to be the Dutch representative at a program titled Women of Note, a concert of music by European Female Composers presented by the European Union Delegation to Canada (https://www.musiccentre.ca/node/138302). Stroobach attended alongside representatives, ambassadors, and ministers from the Embassies and Cultural Institutes of Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain as well as the Netherlands. The concert took place at the Shenkman Arts Centre in Ottawa on March 19, 2016. 
					<br><br>
					Two of Stroobachâs works, Into the Wind for solo violin and Fire Dance for flute, viola and Aboriginal drum, received a live performance at the concert. Ralitsa Tcholakova performed the solo violin part in Into the Wind. Jennifer McLachlen, flute; Ralitsa Tcholakova, viola; and Dominique Moreau, Aboriginal drum, performed Fire Dance. The European Union's Ambassador Marie-Anne Coninsx, Anna Rijk, as well as other representatives from the Dutch Embassy, representatives, and ambassadors from a number of other countries as well as ministers were in the audience.
					<br><br>
					Marie-Anne Coninsx began this special evening with a thought-provoking speech about womenâs achievements in the music world. Stroobach gave a brief talk in both Dutch and English thanking the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for asking her to be the Dutch representative at the Women of Note concert and introducing her two compositions that were performed as well as the talented musicians who performed her music. After the concert the Dutch Embassy presented Stroobach with a beautiful bouquet of flowers and a lovely card. In the card Anna Rijk wrote: âDear Ms Stroobach/Evelyn, Thank you for a beautiful concert, for setting a perfect example of how women can achieve all the desires in their heart and for touching hearts with your pieces. Also, on behalf of Ambassador Kole, thank you so much for making this evening a success. Kindest regards Anna Rijk, Netherlands Embassy.â
					<br><br>
					Anna Rijk also wrote: âAll in all, it was a very successful event, and your contribution was really substantial to the mix of the pieces performed. Thank you again for the kind word expressed on stage with regards of our embassy. It was greatly appreciated.â
					<br><br>
					Dr. Maya Badian, a Romanian â Canadian composer, who attended the Women of Note concert wrote: âI enjoyed listening to your music and I appreciate your gift of composing naturally blended with an interesting manner of structuring your works. I very much like the musical techniques you have chosen to express your musical thoughts ... I also liked how you were dressed â chic and in fashion!â

					Bereft was performed at a Holocaust Memorial Ceremony in 
					<br><br>
					Paramaribo, Suriname, South America
					<br><br>
					The Jewish community of Suriname, on the northeastern coast of South America, is the oldest continuous Jewish community in the Americas. During the Inquisition in Portugal and Spain in the late-fifteenth century, many Jews fled to Holland and to the Dutch colonies to escape torture and condemnation to the stake. Many of the Jews who went to Holland departed later for the Dutch colony of Suriname, arriving as early as the 1630s.
					<br><br>
					Stroobach felt deeply honoured that her composition titled Bereft was performed in Paramaribo, the capital city of Suriname, on March 18, 2016 during a ceremony of the âUnveiling of the Memorial Monument,â which was created âIn Loving Memory of Those who Perished in the Holocaustâ to honour and remember the 104 Surinamese Jews who were killed in the Shoah during World War II. This ceremony took place at the Neve Shalom Synagogue in Paramaribo. (http://www.surinamejewishcommunity.com/#!synagogues/c4fi) The stone monument has the names of all 104 Surinamese Jews inscribed on it. (https://www.timesofisrael.com/70-years-after-the-holocaust-a-surinamese-memorial-for-caribbean-victims/)(http://www.bevrijdingintercultureel.nl/bi/eng/surijoods.html)
					<br><br>
					The ceremony began with speeches given by members of the community, Suriname officials and the Ambassador of Israel to Suriname. This was followed by a performance of Stroobachâs composition Bereft, which was performed by the string section of the Eddy Snijders Orchestra of Suriname, conducted by Maestra Rielle Mardjo. The work was performed to commemorate her great-uncle Abraham (Bram) Fernandes, a resistance fighter and a member of the Geuzen resistance group, who was arrested by the Germans and tortured to death at the Oranjehotel, a German prison in Scheveningen in March 1941. After the performance, additional speeches were given, and the theme from Schindler's List was performed during the carrying of the wreath. In remembrance of the six million Jews who were murdered in the Second World War, six red roses were laid on the remaining three sides of the Memorial Monument by children of prominent members of the Surinamese and/or Jewish Community. The âUnveiling of the Memorial Monumentâ ceremony was attended by ambassadors and representatives from Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Guyana, Israel, The Netherlands, and the USA as well as religious leaders from the Catholic, Protestant, Muslim and Hindu communities.

					<br><br>
					January 27, 2020 was the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps. Stroobach was asked to write an article which was published in the Chai Vekayam (https://kulanu.org/wp-content/uploads/Chai-News-January-2020.pdf) for this occasion. Among the readers of the Chai Vekayam are Dr. Alexander Avram, the Director of the Hall of Names at the Yad Vashem, as well as others who work at the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem. Also, Jacques Grishaver, the Chairman of the Dutch Auschwitz Committee, and Aisley Henrique, the leader of the Jamaican Jewish community are among the newsletterâs subscribers.
					<br><br>
					From the readers of the article, Stroobach has received the following comments:
					<br><br>
					âThank you for sharing this remarkable story. It is an unbelievable story how they survived those terrible times."
					<br><br>
					"You (the editor) are doing outstanding work! We will never forget.â
					<br><br>
					âThis remarkable story really had a profound effect on me.â
					<br><br>
					âIt was very interesting--and very moving--to read this article, in which you clearly documented the experience of your family during the Shoah and WWII. Thank you for sharing it with me. I think there is great importance for current generations in communicating the suffering of previous generations, who were not always willing or able to share their experiences publicly.â
					<br><br>
					âVery profound is the only way I can describe it. The world can be a horrible place, I have seen acts of cruelty and horror in person.  It can also have friendship, love and inspiration. I hope your family finds eternal peace.â  
					<br><br>
					On January 27, 2020, Holocaust Remembrance Day, a ceremony to commemorate the 104 Surinamese Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust was held in front of the Memorial Monument at the Neve Shalom Synagogue in Paramaribo.
					<br><br>
					In the ACWC/AFCC SoundBox: May 2020 internet publication, Stephanie Orlando wrote, âThis article by Evelyn Stroobach on the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps, was published in the âChai Vekayamâ and received heartfelt reviews. Read it here!â
